1. Difference between var , let and const
   => There are some common different between them. First i want to talk about the scope aspect , var is totally function scope . when you declare a variable with var in the function, outsider can't get any access
   to this variable .Other hand let and const are both block scope. If the variable declare with let and const in the curly braces no one outsider can't acess this variable . We can say let and const respect the function scope
   There other more common difference between them  In re-declaration var allow this but in the let and const they don't allow re-declaration . var and let are allow to re-assignment but const don't allow this .
